# Scrapping ideas with Puppeteer

This project was bootstrapped in order to learn how Puppeteer works.

It's separated in 2 files : `index_github.js` and `index_leboncoin.js`

1. The first one launches chromium and log in Githhub to get the names and email addresses of everyone with a John in it's pseudo.

2. The second one goes to lebonchoin and checks the first flatsharing ad, and get its description.
